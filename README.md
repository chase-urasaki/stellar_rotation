# stellar_rotation
Short code that downloads the SAP lightcurve via lightkurve and computes the rotation rates for age estimates.

Optional functionality to estimate the age of the star based on gyrochronology (via gyrointerp).
This is okay since most of the targets that we search for atmospheric escape around are younger targets anyway (with some exceptions)

To do: 
- Input transit parameters (or auto fetch them)
